# UnsupervisedLearningAssignment02_KmeanClustering_TeamPlayerSelection
Problem Statement 1 [5 Marks]
Your task in this assignment is to:

Perform appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing on the wine dataset [1 mark]
Apply DBSCAN clustering to the data and identify any outliers [2 marks]
After finding the best clustering solution and removing outliers, interpret some or all of the clusters and derive domain-specific insights from the results [2 marks]
Data: wine-clustering.csv

Clustering starter ideas:

- Experiment with different values of min_pts and eps in DBSCAN

- Try various feature scaling techniques before applying DBSCAN

- Visualize clusters and outliers using appropriate plots

Problem Statement 2 [5 Marks]
Your task in this assignment is to:

Perform appropriate EDA and preprocessing on the credit card usage dataset [1 mark]
Apply multiple clustering algorithms as specified below [2 marks]
Compare the performance of different clustering algorithms using a clustering metric of your choice [1 mark]
After finding the best clustering solution, interpret some or all of the clusters and derive domain-specific insights from the results [1 mark]
Data: credit_card_usage.zip

Clustering algorithms to apply:

a) Agglomerative clustering
b) DBSCAN
c) K-Means (as an additional algorithm)

Clustering starter ideas:

- For Agglomerative clustering: Experiment with different linkage methods (Single, Complete, Average) and distance measures (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine)

- For DBSCAN: Try different min_pts and eps values

- For K-Means: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters

- Visualize the clusters using appropriate dimensionality reduction techniques
